# Better Smart Home

A selection of nodes to make your own smart home more intelligent.

## Description

Automation in the smart home is a very personal thing. Everyone has different needs, devices and sensors. With this collection of nodes, I try to add value to many smart homes in a simple way.

I myself use the nodes together with a Home Assistant instance. However, any other technology can be used to receive sensor data and control the devices.
